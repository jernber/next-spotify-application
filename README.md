## Reflection


This was a 2 week long project built to try out using react-sliders, Typescript, Next.js, and real time audio. This was a means to come up with a clone that could also take payments as to familiarize myself with learning all sorts of differnt documentation for the features.

One of the main challenges I've ran into is setting up for Stripe. It has the most characters per file, and can be pretty easy to mess up. But what I found the most interesting was the amount of pre-generated code options available on supabase which made connecting the database a breeze as well as auto-generating types for me to copy in.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Tailwind, react-icons, use-sound, Stripe, and supabase.
